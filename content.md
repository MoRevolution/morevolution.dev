# Hi there, I'm Motti ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Data Science student at WashU.

I at Deere as Data Analyst/Data Engineer (part-time), and I contribute to [SocialNLP research](https://github.com/NLP-in-the-Social-Sciences) under [Dr.Labiba Jahan](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs/people/faculty/labiba-jahan), but I'm currently on a short sabbatical.
